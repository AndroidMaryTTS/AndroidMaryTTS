<p>Outlier elimantion algorithms for voice conversion.<br>
    The aim of outlier elimination is to detect source and target pairs
    that might result in reduced conversion performance or artefacts.<br>
    The best working method so far has been the GaussianOutlierEliminator.<br>
    This method fits a single Gaussian to the difference distributions of
    various source and target acoustic features (LSFs, duration, f0,
    energy).<br>
    Then, the pairs with significant difference as compared to distribution
    mean are eliminated.<br>
    The voice conversion training step can also be set to eliminate too
    close pairs, forcing an average amount of unlikeliness in the training
    data.<br>
