<h2><a name="intro"></a> Introduction</h2>

<p>Jampack (JAva Matrix PACKage) is a collection of cooperating classes
    designed to perform matrix computations in Java applications.
    The current version of the Jampack is preliminary and incomplete.
    It is being released to see if there is enough interest to continue
    its development.

<p> Jampack was developed by the author at NIST and the University of
    Maryland. A sibling matrix package, Jama, has also been developed at
    NIST and <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">Mathworks</a>. The two
    packages arose from the need to evaluate alternate designs for the
    implementation of matrices in Java. Jama is based on a single matrix
    class within a strictly object-oriented framework. Jampack uses
    a more open approach that lends itself to extension by the user. As
    it turns out, for the casual user the packages differ principally in
    the syntax of the matrix operations. I hope you will take the time
    to look at <a href="http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/">Jama</a>
    along with Jampack. There is much to be learned from both packages.

<p>The following is a summary of the goals and status of the package.
    For further details see the
    <a href="Doc/00_Manual.html">
        Jampack Owner's Manual</a> or the <a href="Doc/Package-Jampack.html">
        Javadoc documentation</a>.

<h2><a name="goals"></a> Goals </h2>

<p>Jampack was designed with the following considerations in mind.
<ol>

    <li><b> User friendliness.</b> To the casual user Jampack is an
        object oriented package, consisting of classes of matrices and
        classes of methods (called suites) to manipulate matrices. The
        user who wants only to implement a few formulas (e.g, to solve a
        least squares problem) can do so without taking a course in matrix
        computations.

        <p>
    <li><b>Expert friendliness.</b> Jampack provides implementations of
        the the transformations the advanced user needs to implement
        features not in the package. In particular, Jampack supplies
        methods for generating and applying plane rotations and Householder
        transformations.

        <p>
    <li><b>Efficiency.</b> Jampack routines are (or will be)
        moderately efficient. Jampack makes no claim to compete with
        high-performance matrix packages.


        <p>
    <li><b>Openness.</b> In the Jampack view, implementations of
        matrix processes should not be hidden. Instead, each user,
        according to his or her abilities, should be encouraged to look
        under the hood and even tinker with the code. This is the reason
        why Jampack has an Owner's Manual while other packages have User's
        Guides.

        <p>
    <li><b>Extensibility.</b> Jampack was created to be open ended.
        By segregating matrix operations and functions into suites of
        methods that perform related tasks, Jampack makes it easy to add new
        features. Just put the appropriate method in the appropriate
        suite. Or if the feature is sufficiently novel, start a new suite.

        <p>
    <li><b>Growth.</b> If the package catches on, it is hoped that its
        users will contribute to the growth of the package under the
        supervision an review committee.
</ol>

<h2><a name="status"></a> Current Status </h2>

<p>Jampack is not yet a mature package. It does not have all the
    features that a reasonable matrix package should have (for example
    Jampack does not do determinants). The code has only been lightly
    tested and certainly has bugs. Many of the basic operations are soft
    coded--that is, they use other Jampack methods to perform the
    operation, a process that usually requires the creation of matrices to
    hold intermediate results. Finally, there are probably
    inconsistencies and infelicities built into the design of the package
    itself.

<p>Which is to say that one should use Jampack cautiously. The time
    has not yet come to make it a critical part of an application: things
    are too likely to change. But the package can still do a lot. The
    following is a list of what Jampack has and has not.

<ol>

    <p>
        <li><b>Complex matrices.</b> A virtue of Jampack is that it fully
            supports complex matrices. A failing is that there are only
            complex matrices. It was felt that the design should proceed from
            the more general to the less general to avoid painting the package
            into a corner. The implementation of real matrices is the first
            thing on the agenda for extending Jampack

    <p>
        <li><b>Indexing.</b> In books on matrix computations, the
            beginning element of a matrix is its (1,1)-element. Other
            disciplines have other conventions. For example, in queueing
            theory matrices often begin with a (0,0)-element. Jampack allows
            the index of the base element to be set at the beginning of an
            application by the user.

    <p>
        <li><b>Matrix classes.</b> Jampack currently has two matrix
            classes for general matrices (Zmat) and diagonal matrices
            (Zdiagmat). The class Zmat has subclasses for triangular and
            positive semidefinite matrices. It is planned to add band matrices
            and (much later) sparse matrices.

    <p>
        <li><b>Operation suites</b> Jampack segregates its operations in
            suites. Here is a list with links to the Owner's Manual.

            <blockquote><pre>
   Plus, Minus, Times, H, Solve, Inv, Norm,
   Trace, Eye, Block, Merge, Rand, Print.
</pre>
            </blockquote>

            Obviously, there is much to add to this list.

    <p>
        <li><b>Decompositions.</b> Jampack has a basic complement of
            matrix decompositions--i.e, factorizations of matrices. A
            decompositions in Jampack is implemented by a class whose members
            are the factors of the of the decomposition. The decomposition is
            computed by the initializer of the decomposition class. Jampack
            currently supports the following decompositions.

    <p>
    <ol>
        <li> The Pivoted LU decomposition
        <li> The Cholesky decomposition
        <li> The QR decomposition
        <li> The eigendecompostition of a symmetric matrix
        <li> The singular value decomposition
        <li> Hessenberg form
        <li> The Schur Decomposition
        <li> The eigendecompostition of a general matrix
    </ol>


    <p>
    <li><b>History.</b> Some applications have loops that repeatedly
        use a decomposition of an unchanging matrix. To avoid having to
        recompute the decomposition at each iteration of the loop, Jampack
        saves it for reuse on a history list in the matrix in question.
        The mechanics for turning on and off this option are not completely
        specified.

        <p>
    <li><b>Transformations.</b> Jampack has two Suites, Rot and House, for
        generating and applying plane rotations and Householder
        transformations. In addition it has suites for pivoting and
        permuting rows and columns of a matrix.

        <p>
    <li><b>Test programs.</b> The current version of Jampack comes
        with the test programs used to help debug the package. These
        largely uncommented programs do not represent the thorough testing
        required of finished software. But they may be of use to those who
        want to extend the package.

        <p>
    <li><b>Storage allocation.</b></li>
    Jampack uses the Java storage
    allocator to maintain its matrices. For example the Jampack
    statement

    <blockquote> <pre>
C = Times.o(A,B);
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    creates a new instance of a matrix class to hold the product of A
    and B. In a tight loop, this statement could stress the garbage
    collector. Under considerations are extensions like

    <blockquote> <pre>
Times.o(A, B, C);
    </blockquote>
    </pre>

    where the user furnishes a matrix C of appropriate dimensions to
    receive the product of A and B.
