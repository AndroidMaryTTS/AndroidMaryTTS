<p>Jampack (JAva Matrix PACKage) is a collection of classes and
    methods for manipulating matrices. It is designed to be easy for a
    novice to use but rich enough to meet the needs of the expert. It is
    reasonably efficient, although it is not in the high-performance
    league.


<p>Jampack includes classes for several types of matrices (e.g.,
    diagonal and triangular), methods implementing the common matrix
    operations, and methods to compute the most important matrix
    decompositions. The package also includes methods for generating and
    manipulating Householder transformations and plane rotations. A novel
    feature of the package is a history list that remembers decompositions
    that have been computed from a matrix and reuses them later.

<p>The guiding principles of Jampack are openness and extensibility.
    Jampack makes no attempt to hide the implementation of its classes and
    methods--as if such a thing could ever be desirable in matrix
    computations. Instead this manual makes it easy for the user to get
    at the raw code of Jampack. I expect that most people will simply
    want to use the features of Jampack without further ado. But the
    significant minority with special interests or needs can get under the
    hood and tinker. Jampack is yours to play with--which is why this
    document is an owner's manual, not a user's guide.

<p>Jampack is also open ended. Matrix operations, transformations,
    and functions are organized into classes of methods called suites.
    New features to Jampack can be added by placing new methods in
    the appropriate suite. It will often turn out that methods already
    in a suite can be used as templates to guide the coding of a new
    features.

<p>The current version of Jampack is incomplete and tentative--a sort
    of pre-alpha job. All matrices are complex because it was felt that
    implementing real matrices first would cause design conflicts later.
    Of the full complement of matrix types--general, diagonal, band, and
    sparse--only general and diagonal have been implemented. The ensemble
    of matrix functions is incomplete--for example there is not yet a
    routine to compute the determinant. Many of the methods are "soft
    coded"; that is, they are implemented using previously coded Jampack
    functions instead of being written in raw Java. And the code itself
    is sparsely commented and lightly tested.

<p>The main reason for releasing Jampack at this stage is to see if
    there is enough interest in it to justify further development.
    Another reason is to get people interested in contributing to the
    package. I hope that once a reliable core package has been
    established, it will continue to grow by public contributions reviewed
    by a Jampack supervisory committee.

<h3><a name="classes"></a>The classes of Jampack</h3>

<p>Back to:
    <a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
    <a href="01_Overview.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>The classes of Jampack fall into three broad categories: classes
    that define matrices, classes that manipulate matrices, and classes
    that generate matrix decompositions. In addition, there is a class
    defining complex numbers and their operations and a class defining
    global parameters for the package. Let's look briefly at each in
    turn.


<h4> Matrix classes </h4>

<p>There are currently two matrix types implemented in
    Jampack--complex general matrices (Zmat) and complex diagonal matrices
    (Zdiagmat). (Eventually the core package will include real versions
    of these classes and real and complex classes for band matrices.) In
    addition, there are three subclasses of Zmat for upper triangular,
    lower triangular, and positive semidefinite matrices. These classes
    (called tag classes) have no constructors of their own; they exist
    only to allow Jampack to perform certain matrix operations
    efficiently--for example, the solution of linear systems.


<p>Jampack has no vector class, but it does have a class Z1 that
    implements a one dimensional array of type complex. However,
    Z1s do not participate in the usual matrix operations.

<h4> Operation Suites </h4>

<p>The classes for manipulating matrices are called suites. The most
    important suites are the ones that implement the basic matrix
    operations: Plus, Minus, Times, Solve, and H (for conjugate
    transpose). Generally a suite will have several methods. For
    example, the Times suite contains, among others, methods for
    multiplying two Zmats, multiplying a Zmat by its conjugate transpose,
    or multiplying a Zmat by a Zdiagmat. The generic method in any suite
    is named "o". For example, Times.o(A,B) will produce the product of A
    and B for any combination of Zmats and Zdiagmats. Special methods
    have longer names. For example, Times.aha(A) computes A<sup>H</sup>A.

<p>Suites that manipulate matrices are nonaltering or altering. The
    methods of nonaltering suites leave their inputs unchanged. All the
    usual matrix operations fall in this category, as do such functions as
    Norm and Trace. Altering suites change their arguments. The prime
    examples of altering suites are Rot, which manipulates plane rotations,
    and House, which manipulates Householder transformations.


<h4> Decompositions </h4>

<p>Jampack has classes implementing the six basic decompositions of
    matrix computations: the partially pivoted LU decomposition (Zludpp),
    the Cholesky decomposition (Zchol), the QR decomposition (Zqrd,
    Zhqrd), the Schur decomposition (Schur), the spectral decomposition of
    a Hermitian matrix (Zspec) and the singular value decomposition
    (Zsvd). In addition it has an eigenvalue-vector decomposition (Eig).
    For ready use, all members of a decomposition are public.

<h4> Complex numbers </h4>

<p>Complex numbers are implemented by the class Z, which provides useful
    constructors and the usual operations. The operations are written in
    the form c.op(a,b) which causes c to be overwritten by a.op.b. This
    convention allows computations with Zs to proceed without the
    creation of new Zs, which is very important in inner loops.


<h4> Parameters </h4>

<p>The Parameters class contains global parameters that control such
    things as default printing format and the base for indexing matrices.

<h3><a name="indexing"></a> Indexing</h3>

<p>Back to:
    <a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
    <a href="01_Overview.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>A Zmat is implemented as two arrays of type double, one
    representing the real part of the matrix, the other the imaginary
    part. The indexing of these arrays begins at zero, as usual with Java
    arrays. In Jampack we say that a primitive array has a <i>base
        index</i> of zero. Matrices--as opposed to primitive arrays--usually
    have nonzero base indices, which vary from discipline to discipline.
    Consequently, Jampack allows the user to set the base index of the
    matrices in a Java application. To keep things from becoming too
    complicated, the base may be set only once per application.

<h3><a name="history"></a> History</h3>

<p>Back to:
    <a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
    <a href="01_Overview.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>A major problem in any matrix package is to avoid the recomputation
    of decompositions. For example, in solving the system

<blockquote>
    Ax = b
</blockquote>

Jampack computes (at considerable expense) an LU decomposition of A.
The problem is to avoid the recomputation of the decomposition when we
subsequently solve the system

<blockquote>
    Ay = c
</blockquote>
with the same matrix A.

<p>Jampack solves this problem by associating a history list with each
    matrix. When a Jampack method computes a decomposition of a matrix it
    may put it on the history list for later use. This procedure is
    surrounded by rigorous safeguards. While a decomposition is on the
    history list of a matrix, it is not available outside Jampack, and any
    alteration of the elements of a matrix causes its history list to be
    flushed.

    <a href="01_Overview.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>Jampack matrices are not yet serializable, but they will be soon.

<p>Jampack has a utility suite Print that prints primitive arrays and
    matrices in an appropriate format. Default parameters for the
    formatting are defined in the class Parameters and may be changed.
    They may also be specified in the Print methods themselves.
