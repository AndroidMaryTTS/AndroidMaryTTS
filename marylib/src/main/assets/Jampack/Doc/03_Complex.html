Java does not have a primitive complex type, and it is therefore
necessary to implement complex numbers and operations on them as a
class. For Jampack, the class is named Z--the standard name for
double complex floating-point numbers. In this section we will first
describe the fields and constructors defining a complex number and
then turn to the methods that manipulate complex numbers. We will
conclude with a description of the class Z1, which implements a
one-dimensional array of complex numbers.

<p>A complex number is an object of class Z. It consists simply of
    a real and an imaginary part:

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> public double re
        <dd> The real part of the complex number

            <p>
        <dt> public double im
        <dd> The imaginary part of the complex number
    </dl>
</blockquote>


<p>The class Z has four constructors.

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> public Z()
        <dd> Creates a Z and initializes it to zero.

            <p>
        <dt> public Z(double x, double y)
        <dd> Creates a Z whose real part is x and whose
            imaginary part is y.

            <p>
        <dt> public Z(double x)
        <dd> Creates a Z whose real part is x and whose
            imaginary part is zero.

            <p>
        <dt> public Z(Z z)
        <dd> Creates a Z and initializes it to another Z.
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>The class Z has complex versions of zero, one, and the imaginary
    unit.

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> public static final Z ZERO = new Z(0,0)

                <p>
            <dt> public static final Z ONE = new Z(1,0)

                <p>
            <dt> public static final Z I = new Z(0,1)
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>The style of complex operations on Zs is designed to minimize the
    construction of new Zz in inner loops. Most of the operations have
    the form a.op(b,c) in which a can be the same as b or c. Its effect
    is to assign the value of b.op.c to a. Thus to compute e = a*b + c*d
    you can write

<blockquote>
<pre>
z1.Times(a,b);
z2.Times(c,d);
e.Plus(z1,z2);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The intermediate quantities z1 and z2 may be thought of as
    registers that can be created at the beginning of the method doing the
    calculation. These registers can then be reused in subsequent
    calculations, which reduces the need to create new Zs.

<p>The construction a.op(b, c) also returns a pointer to a. This
    means that you can code the above sequence in the more compact
    form

<blockquote>
<pre>
e.Plus(z1.Times(a,b), z2.Times(a,b));
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Since Z is not a primitive object and the values of a Z may change,
    we discourage the use of the "=" operator with Zs. Instead of writing

<blockquote>
<pre>
z1 = z2;
</pre>
</blockquote>

which causes z1 and z2 to point to the same object, write

<blockquote>
<pre>
z1.Eq(z2);
</pre>
</blockquote>

which sets the value of z1 equal to the value of z2.

Here is a list of the Z methods in alphabetical order.

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> public static double abs(Z z)
        <dd> Returns the absolute value of z.

            <p>
        <dt> public static double abs1(Z z)
        <dd> Returns the sum of the absolute values of the
            real and imaginary parts of z.

            <p>
        <dt> public Z Conj(Z a)
        <dd> Sets this Z to the conjugate of a and returns this Z.

            <p>

        <dt> public Z Eq(double a, double b)
        <dd> Resets the real and imaginary of this Z to a and b
            and returns this Z.

            <p>
        <dt> public Z Exch(Z a)
        <dd> Exchanges the this Z and a, so that the value of
            this Z is the original value of a and vice versa.

            <p>
        <dt> public boolean IsEqual(Z z1, Z z2)
        <dd> Tests two Zs for equality.

            <p>

            <p>

            <p>
        <dt> public Z Plus(Z a, Z b)
        <dd> Sets this Z to a+b and returns this Z.

            <p>
        <dt> public Z Times(Z a, Z b)
        <dd> Sets this Z to a*b and returns this Z.

            <p>

<h3><a name="z1"></a> Complex arrays (the class Z1) </h3>

<p>Back to:
    <a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
    <a href="03_Complex.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>The implementation of an array of complex numbers is not a
    straightforward matter. The problem is the interaction of array
    references with cache memories. For such references to be efficient
    it is necessary that references to consecutive array elements
    translate into references to consecutive memory locations, i.e.,
    that an array be stored in a single block of memory.

    Although Java does not specify how arrays of floats or doubles are to
    be stored, most versions of the language seem indeed to store their
    elements contiguously in memory. The same is not true of the members
    of an array of classes. For example, when a one-dimensional array of
    Zs is declared, only space for pointers to the elements of the array
    is allocated. The actual elements must be constructed later. Since
    each construction is an individual affair, there is no guarantee that
    the members of the array will occupy consecutive locations in memory.

<p>The Jampack solution to this problem is to create a special class,
    the class Z1, to implement one-dimensional complex arrays. The
    elements of the array are represented by two double arrays, one
    containing the real part and the other containing the imaginary part.
    The Z1 should not be confused with a vector class. It is intended
    primarily for working storage in matrix algorithms and does not
    participate in the matrix operations that are defined for the core
    matrix classes like Zmat. Moreover, a Z1 has no base index, so that
    all array references in a Z1 begin at zero--just like in an array of
    primitive objects.

<p>The data fields of a Z1 are the following.

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> protected int n
        <dd> The number of elements in the Z1

            <p>
        <dt> protected double re[]
        <dd> The real part of the Z1

            <p>
        <dt> protected double im[]
        <dd> The imaginary part of the Z1
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>The class Z1 has only one constructor.

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> public Z1(int n)
        <dd> Creats a Z1 of length n and initializes it to zero.
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>Z1 has the following methods.

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> public Z get(int i)
        <dd> Returns the i-th elements of this Z1.

            <p>
        <dt> public void put(int i, Z z)
        <dd> Sets the i-th element of this Z1 to z.

            <p>
        <dt> public void put(int i, double real, double imag)
        <dd> Sets the real and imaginary parts of the i-th
            element of this Z1.

            <p>
        <dt> public void Times(int i, Z z)
        <dd> Multiplies the i-th element of this Z1 by z.
    </dl>
