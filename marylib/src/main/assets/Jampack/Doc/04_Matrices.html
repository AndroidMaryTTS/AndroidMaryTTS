This section is devoted to the matrix classes of Jampack. Matrix
classes can be real or complex. Real classes are prefixed with a D
(denoting double). Complex classes are prefixed with a Z (denoting
double complex). At present all classes are complex.

<p>Matrix classes are also divided into core classes and tag classes.
    Core classes are those for which all the standard matrix operations
    are defined. Currently there are two core classes: the Zmat, which
    represents a general complex matrix, and the Zdiagmat, which
    represents a complex diagonal matrix. It is planned to add a class to
    handle band matrices, as well as real versions of the matrix classes.

<p>Tag classes are subclasses of the core classes that inform Jampack
    of special properties of the matrix in question. For example, the tag
    class Zutmat specifies that the matrix is complex upper triangular.
    At present there are three tag classes, Zutmat, Zltmat, and Zpsdmat,
    all extending Zmat. They specify that the Zmat in question is upper
    triangular, lower triangular, and positive semidefinite.


<h3><a name="base"></a> The base index and looping </h3>

<p>Back to:
    <a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
    <a href="04_Matrices.html"> Top of section</a>.


<p>As discussed in the Parameters section each matrix has a base
    index. If the base index of a matrix A is bx, then the element of the
    matrix in the northwest corner is a<sub>bx,bx</sub>. Since different
    disciplines have different indexing conventions, Jampack allows a
    limited control of the base index. The limitations insure that an
    application cannot create matrices with different base indices. For
    more see <a href="02_Parameters.html#base">Parameters.BaseIndex</a>.

<p>The existence of a base index leads to two styles of programming.
    Suppose the base index is zero and we wish to initialize the elements
    of an mxn Zmat A to one. One way is the following

<pre>
   for (i=0; i&lt;m; i++){
      for (j=0; j&lt;n; j++){
         A.put(i, j, Z.ONE);
      }
   }
</pre>

(Here the method "put" sets the (i,j)-element of A to the value of its
third argument.) We call this style of indexing <i> absolute indexing
</i>.

<p>On the other hand, when the Zmat A was created, its constructor set
    its public class members bx, rx, and cx of A to 0, bx+m-1, bx+n-1, so
    that we can write the above loop in the form

<pre>
   for (i=A.bx; i&lt;=A.rx; i++){
      for (j=A.bx; j&lt;=A.cx; j++){
         A.put(i, j, Z.ONE);
      }
   }
</pre>

We call this style of indexing <i> relative indexing</i>.

<p>Absolute indexing is more natural that relative indexing, and in
    most applications it makes no difference which you use--especially,
    since the method <a
            href="02_Parameters.html#adjust">Parameters.adjustBaseIndex</a> can
    be used to a bring nonconforming matrix in line with its companions.
    However, if you are writing general purpose code designed to work with
    any base index, you must use relative indexing.


<h3><a name="zmat"></a> The class Zmat </h3>

<p>Back to:
    <a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
    <a href="04_Matrices.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>The class Zmat (along with its companion to be, the Dmat) is the
    workhorse of Jampack. It implements a general complex matrix and has
    a rich variety of constructors. Its methods are restricted to those
    that manipulate elements and submatrices. General matrix functions
    like addition and multiplication are handled by special suites of
    functions like Plus and Times. In what follows A will denote a
    generic Zmat.

<h4> Public members </h4>

Zmat has five public members, provided to make relative indexing easy.

<blockquote>
    <dl>

        <dt> int bx
        <dd> The base index

        <dt> int rx
        <dd> The upper row index

        <dt> int nr
        <dd> The number of rows

        <dt> int cx
        <dd> The upper column index

        <dt> int nc
        <dd> The number of columns
    </dl>
</blockquote>

These numbers are related by the equations

<blockquote>
    rx = bx + nr - 1, <br>
    cx = bx + nc - 1.
</blockquote>

<p>The Jampack convention is that these parameters are never to be
    altered. But if you think someone has been playing fast and loose
    with them, you can restore their values by coding

<blockquote>
<pre>
A.getProperties();
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
    Zmat has the following constructors.

<blockquote>
    <dl>

        <p>
            <dt> public Zmat(int nrow, int ncol)
        <dd> Creates a Zmat and initializes it to zero.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zmat(double re[][], double im[][])
        <dd> Creates a Zmat and initializes its real and imaginary
            parts to a pair of arrays.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zmat(Z A[][])
        <dd> Creates a Zmat and initializes it to an array of class Z.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zmat(double A[][])
        <dd> Creates a Zmat and initializes its real part to
            to an array of class double. The imaginary part is
            set to zero.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zmat(Zmat A)
        <dd> Creates a Zmat and initializes it to a Zmat.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zmat(Z1 A)
        <dd> Creates a Zmat and initialize it to a Z1.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zmat(Zdiagmat D)
        <dd> Creates a Zmat and initialize it to a Zdiagmat.

    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p> Zmat has a number of methods for retrieving parts of its matrix.
    In the following descriptions the notation (i1:i2,:) and (:,j1,j2)
    refers to rows i1...i2 and columns j1...j2 of a matrix. If ii[] is an
    integer array of length k, then (ii[],:) refers to rows
    ii[0],...,ii[k-1] of a matrix. Similarly if jj[] is an integer array
    of length l, then (:,jj[]) refers to rows jj[1],...,jj[l-1] of a
    matrix. These notations can be mixed to produce submatrices; e.g.,
    (ii[], j1:j2) refers to the submatrix subtended by rows
    ii[0],...,ii[k-1] and columns, j1,...,j2.

<blockquote>
    <dl>

        <p>
            <dt> public double[][] getRe()
        <dd> Returns a copy of the real part of a Zmat.

            <p>
        <dt> public double[][] getIm()
        <dd> Returns a copy of the imaginary part of a Zmat.

            <p>
        <dt> public Z[][] getZ()
        <dd> Returns a copy of the real and imaginary parts as
            a complex array.

            <p>
        <dt> public Z get(int i, int j)
        <dd> Returns the (i,j)-element of a Zmat.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zmat get(int i1, int i2, int j1, int j2)
        <dd> Returns the submatrix (i1:i2, j1:j2)

            <p>
        <dt> public Zmat get(int ii[], int j1, int j2)
        <dd> Returns the submatrix (ii[], j1:j2).

            <p>
        <dt> public Zmat get(int i1, int i2, int jj[])
        <dd> Returns the submatrix (i1:i2, jj[]).

            <p>
        <dt> public Zmat get(int ii[] , int jj[])
        <dd> Returns the submatrix (ii[], jj[]).

    </dl>
</blockquote>

Zmat also contains methods for altering elements and submatrices.

<blockquote>
    <dl>

        <p>
            <dt> public void put(int i, int j, Z a)
        <dd> Writes the (i,j) element of a Zmat.

            <p>
        <dt> public void put(int i1, int i2, int j1, int j2, Zmat A)
        <dd> Overwrites the submatrix (i1:i2, j1:j2) with a Zmat.

            <p>
        <dt> public void put(int ii[], int j1, int j2, Zmat A)
        <dd> Overwrites the submatrix (ii[], j1:j2) with a Zmat.

            <p>
        <dt> public void put(int i1, int i2, int jj[], Zmat A)
        <dd> Overwrites the submatrix (i1:i2, jj[]) with a Zmat.

            <p>
        <dt> public void put(int ii[] , int jj[], Zmat A)
        <dd> Overwrites the submatrix (ii[], jj[]) with a Zmat.

    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the Jampack suites require a matrix decomposition to
    perform their computations. When they compute the decomposition, they
    store a pointer to it on the history list of the Zmat in question. To
    preserve the integrity of the decomposition, it is not directly
    available to the user. Zmat provides three methods that return
    decompositions provided they exist.

<blockquote>
    <dl>

        <p>
            <dt> public Zludpp getLU()
        <dd> Returns an LU decomposition if a valid one exists. Otherwise
            returns null.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zhqrd getHQR()
        <dd> Returns a Householder QR decomposition if a valid
            one exists. Otherwise returns null.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zchol getCHOL()
        <dd> Returns a Cholesky decomposition if a valid one exists.
            Otherwise returns null.

    </dl>
</blockquote>

Note that a call to one of these methods results in the decomposition
being removed from the history list of the Zmat.

<h4> Implementation details and private members </h4>

<p>For reason's explained in the subsection on <a
        href="03_Complex.html#z1"> the class Z1</a>, a Zmat is not implemented
    as an array of Zs. Instead, the elements of a Zmat are stored in two
    two-dimensional arrays of type double, one for the real part and the
    other for the imaginary part. Specifically, the matrix is defined by
    the following class members.

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> protected int nrow
        <dd> The number of rows

            <p>
        <dt> protected int ncol
        <dd> The number of columns

            <p>
        <dt> protected int basex
        <dd> The base index

            <p>
        <dt> protected double re[][]
        <dd> The real part of the matrix

            <p>
        <dt> protected double im[][]
        <dd> The imaginary part of the matrix
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
    <a name="history"></a>
    The history option is implemented by four
    data fields and a method. The data fields are

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> protected boolean dirty
        <dd> True if the matrix has been altered.

            <p>
        <dt> protected Zludpp LU
        <dd> Points to an LU decomposition if there is one.
            Otherwise null.

            <p>
        <dt> protected Hqrd HQR
        <dd> Points to a Householder QR decomposition
            if there is one. Otherwise null.

            <p>
        <dt> protected Zludpp CHOL
        <dd> Points to a Cholesky decomposition if there is one.
            Otherwise null.
    </dl>
</blockquote>

The method is
<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> protected void clean()
        <dd> Nullifies the history pointers if the matrix is
            dirty and sets the dirty flag to false.
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>These members work as follows to insure that decompositions on the
    history list actually correspond to the matrix in a Zmat. Only
    Jampack methods can alter a matrix, and by convention any method that
    alters the matrix sets the dirty flag. Before attempting to use a
    decomposition on the history list, a Jampack method runs clean(),
    which nullifies the history list if the matrix is dirty. The method
    then interrogates the pointer. If it is nonnull, it points to a valid
    decomposition. If it is null, the method must compute the
    decomposition from scratch.

<p>To illustrate the use of these data items and clean, here is
    the code for the function getCHOL.
<blockquote>
<pre>
public Zchol getCHOL(){
   clean();
   Zchol temp = CHOL;
   CHOL = null;
   return temp;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Note that when a user requests a decomposition from history list, it
is removed from the list. This prevents the user from altering
decompositions on the history list.

<h3><a name="tag"></a> The tag classes </h3>

<p>Back to:
    <a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
    <a href="04_Matrices.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>Tag classes are subclasses of a matrix class that tell Jampack
    methods what they can assume about a matrix. Currently all tag
    classes are subclasses of Zmat. They are

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> Zltmat
        <dd> Assume the matrix is lower triangular (or if not
            square lower trapezoidal).

            <p>
        <dt> Zpsdmat
        <dd> Assume the matrix is Hermitian positive semidefinite.

            <p>
        <dt> Zutmat
        <dd> Assume the matrix is upper triangular (or if not
            square, upper trapezoidal).
    </dl>
</blockquote>

The tag classes are null extensions of Zmat. They have no
constructors, data, or methods of their own. They do no error
checking, and the user is entirely responsible for seeing that they
have the properties they announce.

<p>In point of fact, the casual user is unlikely to encounter tag
    classes. Most tag class matrices are generated automatically--usually
    as a part of a decomposition--and the Jampack methods treat them
    properly without user intervention.

<p>In the course of a reduction, a general Zmat A may become, say, upper
    triangular. In Java one cannot simply assign the result of the
    reduction to variable of type Zutmat. Instead one must copy the
    matrix into a Zutmat:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Zutmat U = new Zutmat(A)
</pre>
</blockquote>

An alternative is to copy the original matrix into a Zutmat and
perform the reduction there.

<h3><a name="diag"></a> The class Zdiagmat </h3>

<p>Back to:
    <a href="00_Manual.html#mancont"> Main contents</a>,
    <a href="04_Matrices.html"> Top of section</a>.

<p>The Zdiagmat implements a complex diagonal matrix. In what follows
    D will denote a generic Zdiagmat.

<h4> Public members </h4>

Zdiagmat has three public parameters designed to make
relative indexing easy.

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> public int n
        <dd> The order of the matrix

            <p>
        <dt> public int bx
        <dd> The base index

            <p>
        <dt> public int dx
        <dd> The index of the last diagonal entry
    </dl>
</blockquote>

These quantities are related by the following equation.

<blockquote>
    dx = bx + n - 1.
</blockquote>

<p>As with the Zmat, these public values should not be altered. However, if
    they are you can restore them by coding

<blockquote>
<pre>
D.getProperties();
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Zdiagmat has the following constructors.
<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> public Zdiagmat(int order)
        <dd> Creates a Zdiagmat and initializes it to zero.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zdiagmat(int order, Z val)
        <dd> Creates a Zdiagmat and initializes it to a constant.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zdiagmat(Z1 val)
        <dd> Creates a Zdiagmat and initializes it to a Z1.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zdiagmat(Zmat A, int k)
        <dd> Creates a Zdiagmat and initializes to to a diagonal
            of a Zmat. If k=0 the diagonal is the principal
            diagonal; if k<0, the diagonal is the kth subdiagonal;
            if k>0, the diagonal is the kth superdiagonal. <br>

            Throws a Jampack exception if k is too large or too small.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zdiagmat(Zmat A)
        <dd> Creates a Zdiagmat and initializes it to the principal
            diagonal of a Zmat.

            <p>
        <dt> public Zdiagmat(Zdiagmat D)
        <dd> Constructs a Zdiagmat and initializes it to another
            Zdiagmat.
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>Zdiagmat has two methods to get and retrieve elements.

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> public Z get(int i)
        <dd> Returns the ith diagonal element of this Z.

            <p>
        <dt> public void put(int ii, Z val)
        <dd> Writes the ith diagonal element of this Z with val.
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<h4> Implementation details and private members </h4>

<p>The elements of a Zdiagmat are stored in two one-dimensional arrays
    of type double, one for the real part of the diagonal and the other
    for the imaginary part. Specifically, the matrix is defined by the
    following class members.

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <p>
            <dt> protected int order
        <dd> The order of the matrix

            <p>
        <dt> protected int basex
        <dd> The base index

            <p>
        <dt> protected double re[]
        <dd> The real part of the diagonal

            <p>
        <dt> protected double im[]
        <dd> The imaginary part of the diagonal
    </dl>
</blockquote>
