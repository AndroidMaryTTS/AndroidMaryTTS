 * Well, this class simpliy exists to further emphasis the strong relation
 * between the <code>Attribute</code> class hierarchie and the
 * <code>AttributeExtractor</code> hierarchie. However, since both
 * <code>Attribute</code> and <code>AudioFeature</code> are abstract there is
 * nothing to implement here.
