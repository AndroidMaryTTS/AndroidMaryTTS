<p>This package implements DOM-specific transformation APIs.</p>

<p>The {@link javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMSource} class allows the
    client of the implementation of this API to specify a DOM
    {@link org.w3c.dom.Node} as the source of the input tree. The model of
    how the Transformer deals with the DOM tree in terms of mismatches with the
    <A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#data-model">XSLT data model</A> or
    other data models is beyond the scope of this document. Any of the nodes
    derived from {@link org.w3c.dom.Node} are legal input.</p>

<p>The {@link javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMResult} class allows
    a {@link org.w3c.dom.Node} to be specified to which result DOM nodes will
    be appended. If an output node is not specified, the transformer will use
    {@link javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder#newDocument} to create an
    output {@link org.w3c.dom.Document} node. If a node is specified, it
    should be one of the following: {@link org.w3c.dom.Document},
    {@link org.w3c.dom.Element}, or
    {@link org.w3c.dom.DocumentFragment}. Specification of any other node
    type is implementation dependent and undefined by this API. If the result is a
    {@link org.w3c.dom.Document}, the output of the transformation must have
    a single element root to set as the document element.</p>

<p>The {@link javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMLocator} node may be passed
    to {@link javax.xml.transform.TransformerException} objects, and
    retrieved by trying to cast the result of the
    {@link javax.xml.transform.TransformerException#getLocator()} method.
    The implementation has no responsibility to use a DOMLocator instead of a
    {@link javax.xml.transform.SourceLocator} (though line numbers and the
    like do not make much sense for a DOM), so the result of getLocator must always
    be tested with an instanceof. </p>
