<p>This package implements stream- and URI- specific transformation APIs.
</p>

<p>The {@link javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource} class
    provides methods for specifying {@link java.io.InputStream} input,
    {@link java.io.Reader} input, and URL input in the form of strings. Even
    if an input stream or reader is specified as the source,
    {@link javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource#setSystemId} should still
    be called, so that the transformer can know from where it should resolve
    relative URIs. The public identifier is always optional: if the application
    writer includes one, it will be provided as part of the
    {@link javax.xml.transform.SourceLocator} information.</p>

<p>The {@link javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamResult} class
    provides methods for specifying {@link java.io.OutputStream},
    {@link java.io.Writer}, or an output system ID, as the output of the
    transformation result.</p>

<p>Normally streams should be used rather than readers or writers, for
    both the Source and Result, since readers and writers already have the encoding
    established to and from the internal Unicode format. However, there are times
    when it is useful to write to a character stream, such as when using a
    StringWriter in order to write to a String, or in the case of reading source
    XML from a StringReader.</p>
