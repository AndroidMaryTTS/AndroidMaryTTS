<p>This package implements SAX2-specific transformation APIs. It provides
    classes which allow input from {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler}
    events, and also classes that produce org.xml.sax.ContentHandler events. It
    also provides methods to set the input source as an
    {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader}, or to use a
    {@link org.xml.sax.InputSource} as the source. It also allows the
    creation of a {@link org.xml.sax.XMLFilter}, which enables
    transformations to "pull" from other transformations, and lets the transformer
    to be used polymorphically as an {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader}.</p>

<p>The {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource} class allows the
    setting of an {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader} to be used for "pulling"
    parse events, and an {@link org.xml.sax.InputSource} that may be used to
    specify the SAX source.</p>

<p>The {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXResult} class allows the
    setting of a {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler} to be the receiver of
    SAX2 events from the transformation.

<p>The {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory} extends
    {@link javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory} to provide factory
    methods for creating {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.TemplatesHandler},
    {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.TransformerHandler}, and
    {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader} instances.</p>

<p>To obtain a {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory},
    the caller must cast the {@link javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory}
    instance returned from
    {@link javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory#newInstance}.

<p>The {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.TransformerHandler} interface
    allows a transformation to be created from SAX2 parse events, which is a "push"
    model rather than the "pull" model that normally occurs for a transformation.
    Normal parse events are received through the
    {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler} interface, lexical events such as
    startCDATA and endCDATA are received through the
    {@link org.xml.sax.ext.LexicalHandler} interface, and events that signal
    the start or end of disabling output escaping are received via
    {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#processingInstruction}, with the
    target parameter being
    {@link javax.xml.transform.Result#PI_DISABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING} and
    {@link javax.xml.transform.Result#PI_ENABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING}. If
    parameters, output properties, or other features need to be set on the
    Transformer handler, a {@link javax.xml.transform.Transformer} reference
    will need to be obtained from
    {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.TransformerHandler#getTransformer}, and
    the methods invoked from that reference.

<p>The {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.TemplatesHandler} interface
    allows the creation of {@link javax.xml.transform.Templates} objects
    from SAX2 parse events. Once the {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler}
    events are complete, the Templates object may be obtained from
    {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.TemplatesHandler#getTemplates}. Note that
    {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.TemplatesHandler#setSystemId} should
    normally be called in order to establish a base system ID from which relative
    URLs may be resolved.

<p>The
    {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory#newXMLFilter}
    method allows the creation of a {@link org.xml.sax.XMLFilter}, which
    encapsulates the SAX2 notion of a "pull" transformation. The following
    illustrates several transformations chained together. Each filter points to a
    parent {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader}, and the final transformation is
    caused by invoking {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader#parse} on the final
    reader in the chain.</p>
