    This package provides an API for validation of XML documents. <em>Validation</em> is the process
    of verifying
    that an XML document is an instance of a specified XML <em>schema</em>. An XML schema defines
    the
    content model (also called a <em>grammar</em> or <em>vocabulary</em>) that its instance
    documents
    will represent.
</p>

<p>
    There are a number of popular technologies available for creating an XML schema. Some of the
    most
    popular include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Document Type Definition (DTD)</strong> - XML's built-in schema language.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">W3C XML Schema (WXS)</a></strong> - an
        object-oriented XML schema
        language. WXS also provides a type system for constraining the character data of an XML
        document.
        WXS is maintained by the <a href="http://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> and
        is a W3C
        Recommendation (that is, a ratified W3C standard specification).
    </li>
    <li><strong><a href="http://www.relaxng.org">RELAX NG (RNG)</a></strong> - a pattern-based,
        user-friendly XML schema language. RNG schemas may also use types to constrain XML character
        data.
        RNG is maintained by the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org">Organization for the
            Advancement of
            Structured Information Standards (OASIS)</a> and is both an OASIS and an
        <a href="http://www.iso.org">ISO (International Organization for Standardization)</a>
        standard.
    </li>
    <li><strong><a href="http://www.schematron.com/">Schematron</a></strong> - a rules-based XML
        schema
        language. Whereas DTD, WXS, and RNG are designed to express the structure of a content
        model,
        Schematron is designed to enforce individual rules that are difficult or impossible to
        express
        with other schema languages. Schematron is intended to supplement a schema written in
        structural schema language such as the aforementioned. Schematron is in the process
        of becoming an ISO standard.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Previous versions of JAXP supported validation as a feature of an XML parser, represented by
    either a {@link javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser} or {@link javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder}
    instance.
</p>

<p>
    The JAXP validation API decouples the validation of an instance document from the parsing of an
    XML document. This is advantageous for several reasons, some of which are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Support for additional schema langauges.</strong> As of JDK 1.5, the two most
        popular JAXP parser implementations, Crimson and Xerces, only support a subset of the
        available
        XML schema languages. The Validation API provides a standard mechanism through which
        applications
        may take of advantage of specialization validation libraries which support additional schema
        languages.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Easy runtime coupling of an XML instance and schema.</strong> Specifying the
        location
        of a schema to use for validation with JAXP parsers can be confusing. The Validation API
        makes this
        process simple (see <a href="#example-1">example</a> below).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <a name="example-1"><strong>Usage example</strong>.</a> The following example demonstrates
    validating
    an XML document with the Validation API (for readability, some exception handling is not shown):
</p>
            <pre>
            
    // parse an XML document into a DOM tree
    DocumentBuilder parser = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder();
    Document document = parser.parse(new File("instance.xml"));

    // create a SchemaFactory capable of understanding WXS schemas
    SchemaFactory factory = SchemaFactory.newInstance(XMLConstants.W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI);

    // load a WXS schema, represented by a Schema instance
    Source schemaFile = new StreamSource(new File("mySchema.xsd"));
    Schema schema = factory.newSchema(schemaFile);

    // create a Validator instance, which can be used to validate an instance document
    Validator validator = schema.newValidator();

    // validate the DOM tree
    try {
        validator.validate(new DOMSource(document));
    } catch (SAXException e) {
        // instance document is invalid!
    }
</pre>
<p>
    The JAXP parsing API has been integrated with the Validation API. Applications may create a
    {@link javax.xml.validation.Schema} with the validation API
    and associate it with a {@link javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory} or a {@link
    javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory} instance
    by using the {@link javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory#setSchema(Schema)} and {@link
    javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory#setSchema(Schema)}
    methods. <strong>You should not</strong> both set a schema and call
    <code>setValidating(true)</code> on a parser factory. The former technique
    will cause parsers to use the new validation API; the latter will cause parsers to use their own
    internal validation
    facilities. <strong>Turning on both of these options simultaneously will cause either redundant
    behavior or error conditions.</strong>
