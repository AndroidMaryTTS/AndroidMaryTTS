     * <p/>
     * <dl>
     * <dt><b>begin</b></dt>
     * <dd>This event is raised when the element local timeline begins to play.
     * It will be raised each time the element begins the active duration (i.e.
     * when it restarts, but not when it repeats). It may be raised both in the
     * course of normal (i.e. scheduled or interactive) timeline play, as well
     * as in the case that the element was begun with the <code>
     * beginElement()</code> or <code> beginElementAt()</code> methods. Note
     * that if an element is restarted while it is currently playing, the
     * element will raise an end event and another begin event, as the element
     * restarts.
     * <ul>
     * <li>Bubbles: No</li>
     * <li>Cancelable: No</li>
     * <li>Context Info: None</li>
     * </ul>
     * </dd>
     * <dt><b>end</b></dt>
     * <dd>This event is raised at the active end of the element. Note that
     * this event is not raised at the simple end of each repeat. This event
     * may be raised both in the course of normal (i.e. scheduled or
     * interactive) timeline play, as well as in the case that the element was
     * ended with the <code> endElement()</code> or <code>
     * endElementAt()</code> methods.  Note that if an element is restarted
     * while it is currently playing, the element will raise an end event and
     * another begin event, as the element restarts.
     * <ul>
     * <li>Bubbles: No</li>
     * <li>Cancelable: No</li>
     * <li>Context Info: None</li>
     * </ul>
     * </dd>
     * <dt><b>repeat</b></dt>
     * <dd>This event is raised when the element local timeline repeats. It
     * will be raised each time the element repeats, after the first
     * iteration.<br> The event provides a numerical indication of which repeat
     * iteration is beginning. The value is a 0-based integer, but the repeat
     * event is not raised for the first iteration and so the observed values
     * of the detail attribute will be &gt;= 1.
