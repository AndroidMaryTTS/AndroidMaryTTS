/**
 * <p><a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-smil-animation-20000731/'>SMILAnimation</a>
 * supports several methods for controlling the behavior of animation:
 * <code>beginElement()</code> and <code>endElement()</code>, et al.  These
 * methods are used to begin and end an animation that has declared the timing
 * to respond to the DOM, using the following syntax:</p>
 * <pre>&lt;animate begin="indefinite" end="indefinite" .../&gt;</pre>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Note that only one of <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code> need be
 * specified - either or both can be used.  The <code>beginElement()</code>
 * and <code>beginElementAt()</code> methods must do nothing if the animation
 * is not explicitly set with the <code>begin="indefinite"</code> syntax
 * above. The <code>endElement()</code> and <code>endElementAt()</code>
 * methods must do nothing if the animation is not explicitly set with the
 * <code>end</code><code>="indefinite"</code> syntax above.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Calling <code>beginElement()</code> causes the animation to begin in much
 * the same way that an animation with event-based begin timing begins. The
 * effective begin time is the current presentation time at the time of the DOM
 * method call. Note that <code>beginElement()</code> is subject to the
 * <code>restart</code> attribute in the same manner that event-based begin
 * timing is. If an animation is specified to disallow restarting at a given
 * point, <code>beginElement()</code> methods calls must fail. Refer also to
 * the section <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-smil-animation-20000731/#Restart">Restarting
 * animations</a>.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Calling <code>beginElementAt()</code> has the same effect as
 * <code>beginElement()</code>, except that the effective begin time is offset
 * from the current presentation time by an amount specified as a parameter.
 * Passing a negative value for the offset causes the element to begin as for
 * <code>beginElement()</code>, but has the effect that the element begins at
 * the specified offset into its active duration. The
 * <code>beginElementAt()</code> method must also respect the
 * <code>restart</code> attribute. The restart semantics for a
 * <code>beginElementAt()</code> method call are evaluated at the time of the
 * method call, and not at the effective begin time specified by the offset
 * parameter.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Calling <code>endElement()</code> causes an animation to end the active
 * duration, just as <code>end</code> does. Depending upon the value of the
 * <code>fill</code> attribute, the animation effect may no longer be applied,
 * or it may be frozen at the current effect. Refer also to the section <a
 * href="#Fill">Freezing animations</a>. If an animation is not currently
 * active (i.e. if it has not yet begun or if it is frozen), the
 * <code>endElement()</code> method will fail.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>Calling <code>endElementAt()</code> causes an animation to end the active
 * duration, just as <code>endElement()</code> does, but allows the caller to
 * specify a positive offset, to cause the element to end at a point in the
 * future. Other than delaying when the end actually happens, the semantics are
 * identical to those for <code>endElement()</code>. If
 * <code>endElementAt()</code> is called more than once while an element is
 * active, the end time specified by the last method call will determine the
 * end behavior. </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>The expectation of the following interface is that an instance of the
 * ElementTimeControl interface can be obtained by using binding-specific
 * casting methods on an instance of an animate element. A DOM application can
 * use the <code>hasFeature</code> method of the <a
 * href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113/#ID-5CED94D7">DOMImplementation</a>
 * interface to determine whether the <a
 * href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-smil-animation-20000731/#ElementTimeControl"><code>ElementTimeControl</code></a> interface is
 * supported or not. The feature string for this interface is
 * <code>"TimeControl"</code>.</p>
 *
 * @see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-smil-animation-20000731/">SMIL Animation</a>.
