<p>Apache XML Commons Resolver package.</p>

<p>The classes in this package implement the full semantics of
    <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/html/a401.htm">OASIS Technical
        Resolution 9401:1997 (Amendment 2 to TR 9401)</a> catalogs. Also included
    are a framework of classes designed to read catalog files in
    a number of formats.
</p>

<p>The principal classes in this package are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="Catalog.html">Catalog</a>, implements the
        semantics of OASIS Catalogs.
    <li><a href="Resolver.html">Resolver</a>, demonstrates how the semantics
        of OASIS Catalogs can be extended with these classes.
    <li><a href="CatalogManager.html">CatalogManager</a>, interfaces with the
        Catalog properties file (that controls the default values of certain
        properties).
    <li><a href="TR9401CatalogReader.html">TR9401CatalogReader</a>, reads
        plain text TR9401 catalog files
    <li><a href="OASISXMLCatalogReader.html">OASISXMLCatalogReader</a>, reads
        OASIS XML Catalogs (as defined in the 2001-08-01 committee draft)
    <li><a href="XCatalogReader.html">XCatalogReader</a>, reads John Cowan's
        XCatalog files
</ul>
