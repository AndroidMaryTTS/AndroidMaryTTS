<p>Apache XML Commons Resolver Tools package.</p>

<p>This package implements several tool classes for catalog-based
    entity resolution:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><code>org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.CatalogResolver</code></dt>
    <dd>This class provides a SAX EntityResolver and a JAXP URIResolver.
    </dd>

    <dt><code>org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.ResolvingXMLReader</code></dt>
    <dd>This class provides a SAX2 XMLReader with catalog support.
        The parser uses a CatalogResolver to provide entity resolution.
    </dd>

    <dt><code>org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.ResolvingParser</code></dt>
    <dd>This class provides a SAX1 Parser with catalog support.
        The parser uses a CatalogResolver to provide entity resolution.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>Typically, these classes can be used in other applications. For example,
    running the <a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">Saxon</a>
    XSLT processor with the arguments:</p>

<pre>
    -x org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.ResolvingXMLReader
    -y org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.ResolvingXMLReader
    -r org.apache.xml.resolver.tools.CatalogResolver
</pre>

<p>will provide catalog-based entity resolution for all of the entities
    and stylesheets that you use. (The CatalogResolver can only be used
    with Saxon 6.1 or later.)</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>In order to use these classes, you must have the JAXP 1.1 jar files
    in your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>.</p>
