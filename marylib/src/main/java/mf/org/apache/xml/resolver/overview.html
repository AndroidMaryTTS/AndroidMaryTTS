    <title>Apache XML Common Resolver</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Apache XML Commons Resolver classes implement Catalog-based entity and
    URI resolution.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The resolver class implements the full semantics of OASIS
    <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/html/a401.htm">Technical
        Resolution 9401:1997 (Amendment 2 to TR 9401)</a> catalogs and
    the 06 Aug 2001 Committee Specification of OASIS
    <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/spec-2001-08-01.html">XML
        Catalogs</a>.</p>

<p>It also
    includes a framework of classes designed to read catalog files in
    a number of formats:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The plain-text flavor described by TR9401.
    <li>The <a href="http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/XCatalog.html">XCatalog</a>
        XML format defined by John Cowan
    <li>The XML Catalog format defined by the OASIS
        <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/">Entity Resolution
            Technical Committee</a>.
</ol>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<p>The <a href="org/apache/xml/resolver/tools/package-summary.html">tools
    classes</a> provide "out-of-the-box" SAX1 Parser, SAX2 XMLReader,
    and JAXP URIResolvers. If you're just interested in hooking a
    parser or URI resolver into your application, this is the place to start.
